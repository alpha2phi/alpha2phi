## Project Structure

This repository is structured as a **monorepo** to manage multiple Azure services, infrastructure as code (IaC), and shared utilities. Below is an overview of the directory structure:

```plaintext
/ (root directory)
│
├── /services                # Directory for individual services
│   ├── /api-service          # A microservice (e.g., Azure Function, Web API)
│   │   ├── src/              # Source code for the API service
│   │   ├── tests/            # Unit and integration tests

└── azure-pipelines.yml        # Root CI/CD pipeline (can manage multi-stage pipelines)
```

## Key Components of the Structure:

### 1. Services Directory:
- Each **microservice** (e.g., API, background workers, frontend apps) has its own folder under `/services`.
- Each service contains its own **source code, tests,** and **Dockerfile** (if needed).
- The **infrastructure** for each service (like **Bicep** or **ARM templates**) is located inside the service's directory or in the global `/infrastructure` folder.

### 2. Shared Libraries/Utilities:
- The `/shared` directory contains code **shared across multiple services**, such as **logging utilities**, **authentication modules**, or **common configurations**.
- This structure prevents duplication and ensures **consistency** in utility code across services.

### 3. Infrastructure Directory:
- The `/infrastructure` directory holds all the **infrastructure-as-code (IaC)** configurations (e.g., **Bicep**, **Terraform**, or **ARM templates**) that define the resources in Azure.
- These templates can be **service-specific** or **global**, depending on the deployment requirements.

### 4. CI/CD Pipelines:
- Each service has its own `azure-pipelines.yml` file in its directory, allowing for **service-specific builds and deployments**.
- The **root** `azure-pipelines.yml` manages the overall deployment workflow and could trigger service-specific pipelines or handle infrastructure as a separate deployment pipeline.
- You can also configure **multi-stage pipelines** that deploy code, run tests, and promote artifacts across environments (e.g., **dev, staging, production**).

### 5. CI/CD Strategy:
- Use **Azure DevOps Pipelines** or **GitHub Actions** to automate builds and deployments.
- For each service, create **independent CI/CD pipelines** to build, test, and deploy the service.
- For infrastructure, set up a pipeline that provisions or updates Azure resources using **Bicep** or **Terraform**.
- Use **Azure DevOps Pipelines' multi-stage features** for complex workflows (e.g., deploying to different environments).
